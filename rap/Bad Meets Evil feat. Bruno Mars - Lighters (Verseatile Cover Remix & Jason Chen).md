By the time you hear this song, I'll be long gone,
leave a legacy for my unborn son, he can carry on,
music ain't my master, doesn't matter where I take it from,
long as I provide some kind of message into every song,
can't forget when I got that phone call,
heard my momma couldn't speak a word, put up stone walls,
didn't understand the problem, couldn't go on,
hated everybody else, yeah my anger lasted so long/

but at the end of the tunnel, I saw a shining light, it gripped me by the heart as I grumbled, I saw what life was like/ I tried to take control myself, but I had blinded eyes, thought the truth was found in the world but I was finding lies/ I thank the Lord for the way that he had rescued me, he never left my side and my momma spoke eventually/ it's one of many memories that I have inside, you feeling what I'm saying put your lighters in the sky

As a child growing up, had a dream of blowing up,
memorizing music sing myself to sleep when no one's up,
this is my expression when I'm venting as I open up,
hoping for the best when I stress having no income,
too much time passing over, I can tell I'm acting older,
no more fun and games, sayonara Casanova,
used to love the nightlife, sipping on my Jack and cola,
now I want a nice wife, get my life back in order/

but am I ever satisfied in this life of mine, thought I was supposed to be somebody with a light to shine/ I have no clue, tell me God, what you have in mind, help me surrender like a vessel as you lead the blind/ one of a kind, every line that you speak is truth, the only reason why you got me speaking in this booth/ forever grateful and I do this for the most high, feeling what I'm saying put your lighters in the sky
